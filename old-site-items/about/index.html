Hi there! Thanks for checking out my site.  Its theme is a modified version of the Editorial HTML5 template, and is hosted through GitHub pages.  If you have comments, I’d love to hear them at piccirilloj1 at gmail.com! (or github.com/jpiccirillo).  I take pride in this site and update it as regularly as I can with personal projects I’m working on.  Input / suggestions are critical to learning best practices, and with a web-based learning approach I certainly miss things.

                    <p><span class="image left"><img src="aboutme-21.JPG" /></span> Hi I'm Jeffrey - a software engineer, earth scientist, and photographer living in Austin, TX.  I'm currently on the lookout for an <span style="font-weight:600">engineering role in Austin where I can use my passion for developement and geospatial data.</span></p>

                    My primary interests bring together earth science, computer science, and visualization:
                    <li>Using scientific methods to better understand our world</li>
                    <li>Displaying the resulting data cleanly and efficiently</li>
                    <li>Using computer science to write software making this process accessible and reliable for everyone</li>

                    <p style="margin-top: 2em;">Most recently, I studied at UW-Madison completing the <a href="https://www.cs.wisc.edu/academics/graduate-programs/pcp" target="_blank">Professional Capstone Certificate Program in Computer Sciences</a> and working as a GIS developer at the <a href="https://www.sco.wisc.edu/sco/" target="_blank">Wisconsin State Cartographer's Office</a>.  While there, I developed and improved web-applications that visualized interactive geospatial info, like microbial resistance datasets from hospitals and state-wide historical aerial photography.  I also wrote Python scripts to clean and standardize data for use by Wisconsin counties and residents.</p>

                    <p>Prior to this, I completed my bachelor’s degree in Earth Sciences at Rice University in Houston, TX.  While there, I became passionate about <span style="font-weight:500">geospatial visualization, data science, and clean graphic design</span>, which I prioritize in my computer science and geographic work. Beyond the sciences, I'm fascinated by writing systems and scripts - Through college coursework and language immersion in Amman, Jordan, I began to learn Arabic, and even took a stab at designing a font that embodied some stylistic and visual characteristics I wasn't able to find in pre-existing typefaces.</p>

                    <p>From field work in Turkey, Iceland and America to travel to the Middle East, I've had chances to spend time in other countries and cultures - experiences I wouldn't trade for anything.  As field sites are based on important geology rather than tourism, field work gave me a serene and original view of locations that I wouldn't have gained otherwise. Because of this, surrounding myself with nature, the sun, and wildlife is how I most successfully relax and de-stress.</p>

                    <!-- <p>My long-term plans include pursuing graduate education in GIS / Geography / Cartography, and finding opportunities to sharpen my skills in programming and design. My short-term plans include remembering to study for the GRE and deep breathing.</p> -->

                    <p>Thanks for stopping by!</p>
